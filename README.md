# 📚 Library Management System — Spring Boot

A backend application built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **H2 Database**,  
that manages books, members, transactions, and reports — just like a real-world library system.

This is the Java Spring Boot version of the C# console app you built earlier.
